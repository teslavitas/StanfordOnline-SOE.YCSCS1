Activation record (frame) structure
-----------------------------------
Note: Stack grows from high addresses to low.
Stack state at the beginning of a dispatch operation:

low addresses
|   	|<- $sp (stack pointer)
|...	|
|xxx	|<- $fp (frame pointer)
high addresses

Stack state just before control is redirected to callee:

|   	|<- $sp (stack pointer)
|arg N	|arguments 0-N
|...	|
|arg 0	|
|...	|
|xxx	|<- $fp (frame pointer)

$a0 contains dispatch object.

Structure of an activation method in stack when method body starts executing:

|   	|<- $sp (stack pointer)
|$ra	|(return address)
|$fp	|(old frame pointer)
|self	|(current object)
|var M	|variabled 0-M
|...	|
|var 0	|
|arg N	|arguments 0-N
|...	|
|arg 0	|<- $fp (frame pointer)

Stack structure when control is returned to caller
|   	|<- $sp (stack pointer)
|...	|
|xxx	|<- $fp (frame pointer)

$a0 contains method result.
